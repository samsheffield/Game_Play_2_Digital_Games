      <h2>RESOURCES</h2>
      <p>Here are a few of the resources which fed into this week's material:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>3DBuzz Moving Platforms tutorial (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkGPoZOQE5Q&list=PLt_Y3Hw1v3QSFdh-evJbfkxCK_bjUD37n&index=4">link</a>)</li>
        <li>How to set up 2D character colliders(<a href="http://johnstejskal.com/wp/setting-up-your-characters-2d-colliders-in-unity/">link</a>)</li>
        <li>Custom Editors in Unity: Gizmos (<a href="http://www.ryan-meier.com/blog/?p=40"></a>)</li>
        <li>2D in Unity3D with Parallaxing (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXREh5hacV0">link</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>PROJECT 2: PLATFORMER, NARRATIVE (DUE 12/16)</h2>
      <p>For the final project, you will be responsible for completing a small 2D game which uses platformer mechanics to tell a story. This narrative can be specific, atmospheric, linear, or non-linear. It can be an original story, fiction, non-fiction, autobiographical, or based on some other pre-existing (non-game, non-film) source(s). Lastly, while text can be used to establish the narrative elements, it must also be conveyed somehow through the game's mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics.</p>

      <p>As with the last project, everyone will work in small groups to design, prototype, and develop a single completed game which will be presented on the last day of class (12/16). The workload must be shared equally between all team members. It will be your collective responsibility to delegate tasks (who will code what parts, who will handle visual assets, who will be responsible for sound, etc.) At the end of the project, each team member will responsible for completnig a peer review to provide feedback on his/her partners.</p>

      <h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2> 
      <ul>
        <li>One player only.</li>  
        <li>Focused on telling a story.</li>      
        <li>Multiple highly polished levels ok, though I'd recommend sticking to one, if possible.</li>
        <li>Game must have an end condition.</li>
        <li>Controls limited to: directional movement controlled by a joystick/gamepad, 2 input buttons, 1 start button (no more! no mouse!)</li>
        <li>Must include the following scenes (at minimum): Start, Game, End</li>
        <li>Complete instructions somehow include in-game.</li>
        <li>A Cohesive and memorable concept established through sound, visuals, and animation.</li>
        <li>Unique assets (no unlicensed sound or visuals)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>BEGIN PROJECT 2 (DUE AT BEGINNING OF CLASS AFTER THANKSGIVING!)</h2>
      <p>Ideation/planning phase. Meet with your teammates once before next week (either in-person, or online) to prepare the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>1 x game document: Brief written description of your game (what is the story you are telling? what is the goal?, what is the theme/concept?, what are the most important mechanics?) </li>
        <li>2 x mechanics references: Research (at least) two points of reference which demonstrate the mechanics you are interested in exploring. Provide links.</li>
        <li>3 x inspirational references: Visual or non-visual references which you think will inform your game in some way. Provide links.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Use Google Drive or some other online storage to save and share this material between team members.</strong> An absent/late teammember will not be an acceptable excuse for not being prepared next week.</p>
      <p><strong>We will discuss these together at the beginning of class next week, so please email these things to me by 9am.</strong></p>
