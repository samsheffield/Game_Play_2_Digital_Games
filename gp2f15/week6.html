      </ul>

      <h2>UNITY 2D : PART 5</h2>
      <p>Examples from class can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/samsheffield/Game_Play_2_Digital_Games/releases/tag/u4f15">here</a></p>

      <h2>ANIMATOR RESOURCES</h2>
      <p> For anyone struggling with the Animator (including the 7 of you who were sick, left early, etc.).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Working with Unity's Animator for sprite-based animation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfQwVHk21hw">video</a> </li>
        <li>Some info on connecting to Animator parameters from scripts: <a href="http://michaelcummings.net/mathoms/creating-2d-animated-sprites-using-unity-4.3">webpage</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>NOTE: Since these are based on older versions of Unity, some of the details are a little out of date (Animator UI might look a little different). However, they are still solid references, if you need some additional help.</p>

      <h2>PROJECT 1: SCORE-BASED GAME (DUE 10/28)</h2>   
      <p>For the first project, you will be responsible for completing a single level, score-based game for one player. Your focus will be on on designing a gameplay experience that is challenging, fun, and can be played repleatedly for score. The theme, mechanics, and scoring system of the game are completely up to you, as long as they work with the requirements listed below.</p>

      <p>Everyone will work in small groups to design, prototype, and develop a game which will be presented at the start of class on the 28th. The workload must be shared equally between all team members. It will be your collective responsibility to delegate tasks (who will code what parts, who will handle visual assets, who will be responsible for sound, etc.) At the end of the project, each team member will responsible for completing a peer review to provide feedback on his/her partners.</p>  

      <h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2> 
      <ul>
        <li>One player only.</li>        
        <li>One highly polished game level (no more!).</li>
        <li>Game must have an end condition.</li>
        <li>A scoring system which encourages replayability.</li>
        <li>Controls limited to: directional movement controlled by a joystick/gamepad, 2 input buttons, 1 start button (no more! no mouse!)</li>
        <li>Must include the following scenes (at minimum): Start, Game, End</li>
        <li>Complete instructions somehow include in-game.</li>
        <li>A Cohesive and memorable concept established through sound, visuals, and animation.</li>
        <li>Unique assets (no unlicensed sound or visuals)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>PROJECT TEAMS</h2>

      <h1>HOMEWORK</h1>
      <h2>GAME PROTOTYPE 5</h2>
      <p>Using the materials covered in class today, create a small prototype which includes...</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Includes animation that is controlled in at least 3 different states through code.</li>
        <li>No game required, just spend time with the Animator.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>BEGIN PROJECT 1 (DUE AT BEGINNING OF CLASS NEXT WEEK!)</h2>
      <p>Ideation/planning phase. Meet with your teammates once before next week (either in-person, or online) to prepare the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>1 x game document: Brief written description of your game (what is the goal?, what is the theme/concept?, what are the most important mechanics?) </li>
        <li>2 x mechanics references: Research (at least) two points of reference which demonstrate the mechanics you are interested in exploring. Provide links.</li>
        <li>3 x inspirational references: Visual or non-visual references which you think will inform your game in some way. Provide links.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Use Google Drive or some other online storage to save and share this material between team members.</strong> An absent/late teammember will not be an acceptable excuse for not being prepared next week.</p>
      <p><strong>We will discuss these together at the beginning of class next week, so please email these things to me by 9am.</strong></p>
