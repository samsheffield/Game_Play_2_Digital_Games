      <h2>CAMERA</h2>
      <p>Camera systems in 2D games are deceptively simple. When well designed, they are not noticed at all!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shaun Inman takes apart Super Mario World's camera, which is often considered the ultimate sidescroller camera (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCIMPYM0AQg">link</a>)</li>
        <li>There is no one camera to rule them all, unfortunately. Great overview of 2D sidescroller cameras by Itay Keren! (<a href="http://gamasutra.com/blogs/ItayKeren/20150511/243083/Scroll_Back_The_Theory_and_Practice_of_Cameras_in_SideScrollers.php">link</a>)</li>

      <h1>HOMEWORK</h1>

      <h2>PLATFORMER PROTOTYPE</h2>
      <p>Create a single platforming level which pits the player against the environment (don't focus on player vs. enemy conflict on this one.) In addtion, include a player which has 3 states of animation (example: idle, walk, jump) that are triggered through input.</p>

      <p>Compelling level design involves the thoughful manipulation of a player's movement through space. Experiment with the arrangement of platform elements in your level to inform, confound, or challenge the player. Feel free to add a narrative element to your level, though make it secondary to the level's design.</p>
