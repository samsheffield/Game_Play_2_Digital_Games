      <h2>TODAY:</h2>
      <p>Welcome everyone!</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Introductions + Q &amp; A</li>

      <h2>LET'S START HERE</h2>
      <blockquote>“Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”</blockquote>

        <li>Listen.</li>
        <li>Ask questions.</li>
        <li>Practice (obsessively).</li>
        <li>Be brave (you will make mistakes).</li>
        <li>Be generous.</li>
        <li>Don't wait (keep going).</li>

      <h2>ANALYZING GAMES</h2>
      <p>This semester, we'll not only spend a lot of time making games, we'll also devote a good portion of the semester to studying, analyzing, &amp; discussing games.</p>
      <p>Game analysis vs. game reviews. This is an important distinction to make...</p>

      <h2>GAME ANALYSIS TOOL: THE MDA FRAMEWORK</h2>
      <blockquote>MDA is a formal approach to understanding games– one which attempts to bridge the gap between game design and development, game criticism, and technical game research.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>MDA stands for Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics</li>
        <li>This approach to analyzing games comes from <a href="docs/mda.pdf">this research</a>, MDA: A Formal Approach to Game Design and Game Research.</li>
        <li>MDA framework formalizes our understanding of games as artifacts by breaking them into three distinct components: RULES > SYSTEM > "FUN"</li>
        <li>It establishes design counterparts of these components: MECHANICS > DYNAMICS > AESTHETICS</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>THREE DESIGN COMPONENTS</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mechanics</strong> describes the particular rules and systems of the game. <em>What can be done in the game.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Dynamics</strong> describes the actual experiential play that emerges from the mechanics. <em>What we are actually doing in the game.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Aesthetics</strong> describes the emotional responses evoked by the dynamics, in the player. <em>Why we play the game.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <p>These components have a causal relationship, which is understood starting from opposite ends as designers and players:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>From the designer's perspective, the mechanics give rise to dynamic system behavior, which in turn leads to particular aesthetic experiences.</li> 
        <li>From the player's perspective, aesthetics set the tone, which is born out in observable dynamics and eventually, operable mechanics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>GAME AESTHETICS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Game aesthetics are more complex than just how the game looks. They describe things evoked by the game. For example, why we consider a game "fun".</li>
        <li>Game aesthetics include these 8 types:</li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Sensation</strong>: Game as sense-pleasure</li>
        <li><strong>Fantasy</strong>: Game as make-believe</li>
        <li><strong>Narrative</strong>: Game as drama</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge</strong>: Game as obstacle course</li>
        <li><strong>Fellowship</strong>: Game as social framework</li>
        <li><strong>Discovery</strong>: Game as uncharted territory</li>
        <li><strong>Expression</strong>: Game as self-discovery</li>
        <li><strong>Submission</strong>: Game as pastime</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>JOUSTS</h2>
      <p>Let's play Lemon Jousting, followed by Johann Sebastian Joust. Anyone remember <a href="http://www.deepfun.com/lemon-jousting/">the rules</a>?</p>

      <p>Afterwards...</p>
      <ol>
        <li>How was the design of JS Joust influenced by Lemon Jousting?</li>
        <li>What's carried over?</li>
        <li>What's changed?</li>
        <li>Which game aesthetics are present?</li>
        <li>What are the dynamics?</li>
        <li>What are the mechanics?</li>
      </ol>
