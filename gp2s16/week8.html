      <h1>10/21: PROJECT WORK SESSION 2</h1>
      <h2>TODAY:</h2>
      <p>Welcome back!</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Project 1 now due at <strong>9:30</strong> next week.</li>
        <li>Project 1 work session.</li>
        <li>Discuss Project 1 progress.</li>
        <li>Project 1 playtesting.</li>
        <li>Exporting game builds.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>PROJECT 1 SCHEDULE</h2>
      <p>This is the project schedule:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>THIS WEEK: Work session 2, playtesting after lunch, exporting builds</li>
        <li>NEXT WEEK: Project uploaded to class Drive by 9:30am. No exceptions. Mandatory attendance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>THIS MORNING: DISCUSS PROJECT 1 PROGRESS + WORK SESSION </h2>
      <p>Work until lunch. While you're working...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I will be meeting with each group to check progress.</li>
        <li>Please hold technical questions until I've had a chance to check in with everyone.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>GAME BALANCE</h2>
      <p>In game design, balance refers to the tuning of a game's mechanics to identify and fix innefective or problematic elements.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Game balancing is not an exact science (more like a black art!)</li>
        <li>Game balancing is only useful if the core mechanics of your game are already in place.</li>
        <li>Game balance is often done through playtesting, but you can also rely on your instincts as a game designer. (MATH works well for particular games with complex cost/benefit ratios)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Game Balancing Methodologies... (It's all about the feels!)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is the challenge in my level feel appropriate?</li>
        <li>Does one strategy feel better or worse than any other?</li>
        <li>Does my level feel <i>innately</i> complex, or does the complexity <i>emerge</i> from simple mechanics?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>"ENJOY EVERYTHING" : A QUICK LOOK AT LEVEL DESIGN IN MARIO GAMES </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Shigeru Miyamoto discusses World 1-1 of Super Mario Bros. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGRJRUWafY">link</a>)</li>
        <li>Nintendo uses a 4 step "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish%C5%8Dtenketsu">Kishoutenketsu</a>" (起承転結) inspired method to design levels. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBmIkEvEBtA">More info</a>) (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0c5Le1vGp4">Follow up</a>)</li>
        <li>BTW, did you know that we're currently running a Mario Maker contest?</li>
        <li>Gamasutra interview with Koichi Hayashida, director of Super Mario 3D Land &amp; Super Mario 3D World (<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/168460/the_structure_of_fun_learning_.php">link</a>)</li>
        <li>BTW, BTW, Nintendo still takes a relatively informal approach to playtesting.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>PLAYTESTING. GOOD GAMES ARE BUILT THROUGH ITERATION</h2>
      <p>Just a reminder...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Observe... Don't get involved.</li>
        <li>Follow up by asking specific questions.</li>
        <li>Disparate feedback? Aim for the middle!</li>
        <li>Respond to one thing at a time and then... more playtesting!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>PLAYTESTING SESSION</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Work with your team to write down 3 questions for players.</li>
        <li>Take turns playing each other's games.</li>
        <li>Provide relevant <i>written</i> feedback to each group.</li>
      </ol>
